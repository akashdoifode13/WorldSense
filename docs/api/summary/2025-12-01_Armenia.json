  "summary_text": "## Armenia Daily Economic Summary - December 1, 2025\n\n**Overall Economic Sentiment:** The Armenian economy continues its trajectory of normalization following a period of exceptional growth driven by re-exports and capital inflows. While growth is moderating, it remains robust, supported by strong domestic demand and an improving fiscal position. International partnerships and digital sector expansion are emerging as key drivers for future sustainable growth.\n\n---\n\n### GDP & Economic Growth\n\n*   **Normalizing Growth Trajectory:** Armenia's GDP growth has normalized to 5.6% in H1 2025, down from the exceptional surge seen in 2022-2023. This deceleration is attributed to the unwinding of temporary factors like re-exports linked to the situation in Ukraine.\n*   **Strong Q3 Performance:** Preliminary data indicates a significant 6.2% year-on-year GDP growth in the third quarter of 2025, reaching 3.07 trillion drams. This suggests continued underlying strength in the economy.\n*   **Future Projections:** The World Bank forecasts a GDP growth of 5.2% for 2025, with projections of 4.9% in 2026 and a gradual slowdown to 4.7% by 2027. These projections, however, may not fully capture the impact of recent geopolitical developments and new transit routes.\n*   **Sectoral Acceleration:** In September, Armenia's economy experienced a sharp acceleration, posting 10.5% year-on-year growth, primarily driven by manufacturing and metals production, according to the World Bank. This indicates a potential rebound in industrial output.\n*   **Regional Context:** Armenia, along with other European Neighbourhood East countries, recorded a collective GDP of \u20ac298.1 billion in 2023, a 4.7% increase from the previous year.\n\n**Implications:** While the extraordinary growth phase has passed, the Armenian economy is demonstrating resilience with strong quarterly performance and projected healthy annual growth. The acceleration in September, driven by industrial sectors, is a positive signal for diversification. However, the World Bank's forecast of a gradual slowdown warrants attention for potential policy adjustments to sustain momentum.\n\n---\n\n### Inflation & Monetary Policy\n\n*   **Stable Interest Rates:** The Central Bank of Armenia maintained its benchmark interest rate at 6.75% during its November 2025 meeting. The deposit rate remains at 5.25% and the lending rate at 8.25%. This indicates a cautious stance and a focus on price stability amid normalizing growth.\n*   **Exchange Rate Dynamics:** In September 2025, the USD depreciated against the AMD, with the exchange rate at AMD 382 per USD, a decrease of AMD 5 compared to September 2024. This suggests a strengthening Armenian Dram, which could have disinflationary effects.\n*   **Inflationary Pressures in CIS:** Despite stronger exchange rates in the CIS-4 region, including Armenia, there are increasing pro-inflationary pressures. This suggests that the positive impact of currency appreciation on inflation might be counteracted by other factors.\n\n**Implications:** The Central Bank's decision to hold rates steady suggests confidence in the current monetary policy stance. The strengthening Dram is beneficial for import costs but could impact export competitiveness. The observation of mounting inflationary pressures in the broader CIS region warrants continued monitoring for potential spillover effects.\n\n---\n\n### Fiscal Policy & Government Actions\n\n*   **Exceptional Fiscal Performance:** Armenia's cumulative budget deficit for the first nine months of 2025 was a mere 0.73% of GDP, significantly below the projected 5.5% for the year. This reflects prudent fiscal management and potentially higher-than-expected government revenues.\n*   **Economic Policy Doctrine:** The Armenian government is slated to adopt an economic policy doctrine in its first meeting of 2026, signaling a forward-looking approach to economic strategy.\n*   **Potential Aid Package:** The Central Bank has commented on a potential 150 billion dram aid package for businesses, indicating the government's awareness and potential willingness to support economic actors, possibly in response to past or anticipated challenges.\n*   **Food Safety Regulation:** A local dairy producer's production of three products has been suspended due to the detection of pathogenic bacteria, highlighting the ongoing importance of regulatory oversight in food safety.\n\n**Implications:** The significantly lower budget deficit is a strong positive for fiscal sustainability and provides fiscal space for future investments or stimulus measures. The forthcoming economic policy doctrine is crucial for outlining the long-term growth strategy. The food safety incident, while isolated, underscores the need for continued robust inspection and enforcement.\n\n---\n\n### Trade & International Relations\n\n*   **Deepening US Collaboration:** Armenia and the U.S. are deepening discussions on economic collaboration, with meetings focusing on strengthening ties and exploring new opportunities.\n*   **Regional Transport and Logistics Cooperation:** Armenia and Georgia are actively discussing cooperation in transport and logistics, aiming to enhance regional connectivity and trade flows.\n*   **India as Key Arms Exporter:** India has emerged as the biggest arms exporter to Armenia, indicating a growing strategic defense partnership and a diversification of Armenia's defense procurement.\n*   **EAEU-India Trade Negotiations:** Negotiations for a free trade agreement between the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) and India have commenced, signaling a significant move towards expanding trade ties and market access for Armenian businesses within the EAEU framework.\n*   **Exploration with T\u00fcrkiye:** Armenia and T\u00fcrkiye are exploring cooperation opportunities within the TRIPP project, indicating a potential for improved economic relations and trade diversification.\n*   **Iran-Armenia Projects:** Implementation of key projects between Iran and Armenia, including the third electricity transmission line and gas bartering deals, is being emphasized, highlighting continued bilateral economic engagement.\n\n**Implications:** Armenia is actively pursuing a multi-faceted international economic agenda. The growing partnership with India, both in defense and potential trade, is noteworthy. The EAEU-India FTA could unlock new markets. The engagement with T\u00fcrkiye suggests a pragmatic approach to regional economic integration, while continued collaboration with Iran remains a constant.\n\n---\n\n### Labor Market & Unemployment\n\n*   **Declining Unemployment:** The unemployment rate in Armenia fell to 14% in the first quarter of 2025, down from 15.5% in Q1 2024. Employment and labor force participation rates stood at 50.1% and 58.2%, respectively.\n\n**Implications:** The downward trend in unemployment is a positive indicator of a strengthening labor market and improving economic conditions. This suggests that economic growth is translating into job creation.\n\n---\n\n### Currency & Exchange Rates\n\n*   **AMD Appreciation:** As noted in the inflation section, the USD has depreciated against the AMD in September 2025, indicating a strengthening Armenian Dram.\n\n**Implications:** A stronger Dram can help to reduce the cost of imports and potentially curb imported inflation. However, it could also make Armenian exports more expensive, impacting their competitiveness in international markets.\n\n---\n\n### Emerging Themes and Insights\n\n*   **Diversification of Partnerships:** Armenia is actively broadening its international economic relationships, engaging with major global players like the U.S. and India, as well as regional partners like Georgia, T\u00fcrkiye, and Iran. This diversification reduces reliance on any single market or partner.\n*   **Focus on Sustainable Growth:** The normalization of growth, coupled with the forthcoming economic policy doctrine and the emphasis on digital sector expansion, suggests a strategic shift towards more sustainable and less volatile growth drivers beyond temporary re-exports.\n*   **Strengthening Fiscal Position:** The significantly improved budget deficit highlights sound fiscal management, providing a solid foundation for future economic development and stability.\n*   **Geopolitical Influence on Economic Trajectory:** Recent geopolitical agreements and the development of new transit routes are expected to play a significant role in shaping Armenia's economic future, requiring continuous analysis and adaptation.",
