  "summary_text": "# Azerbaijan Economic Daily Briefing - December 1, 2025\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nToday's economic landscape for Azerbaijan reveals a picture of steady, albeit modest, growth, underpinned by increasing international engagement and a strategic pivot towards non-oil sectors. Inflation remains a key concern, though the central bank's monetary policy appears to be holding steady. Fiscal policy is focused on future development, including the nascent cryptocurrency sector, while trade relations are being actively expanded across diverse geographies. The labor market is seeing proactive budgetary planning, and the national currency remains stable.\n\n## GDP & Economic Growth\n\n*   **Modest GDP Expansion:** Azerbaijan's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) experienced a growth of 1.3% year-on-year for the period of January to September 2025. This indicates a measured but positive expansion in economic activity, though it falls below some international forecasts.\n*   **Revised Growth Projections:** The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) has revised its 2025 GDP growth forecast for Azerbaijan downwards by 1 percentage point, now projecting a 2% expansion for the year. However, the EBRD anticipates a stronger growth of 2.5% in 2026, signaling confidence in medium-term prospects.\n*   **Focus on Non-Oil Sectors:** There is a discernible strategic pivot towards non-oil sector growth, suggesting efforts to diversify the economy away from its traditional reliance on hydrocarbon exports.\n*   **Infrastructure Investment Planned:** The government intends to borrow approximately $5 billion from international credit institutions to fund large-scale infrastructure projects, including those in recently secured territories. This signals a significant commitment to future development and economic expansion.\n*   **Regional Trade Hub Ambitions:** The Asian Development Bank (ADB) plans to invest up to $2.5 billion to support Azerbaijan's transformation into a key regional hub connecting Central Asia and Europe. This partnership underscores Azerbaijan's strategic geographical position and its potential to leverage trade and connectivity.\n\n**Implications:** The GDP figures suggest a resilient economy, but the downward revision by the EBRD warrants monitoring. The significant planned borrowing and ADB investment highlight a proactive approach to economic diversification and infrastructure development, aiming to unlock new growth drivers.\n\n## Inflation & Monetary Policy\n\n*   **Annual Inflation at 5.9%:** Azerbaijan's annual inflation rate reached 5.9% in October 2025. This figure is slightly higher than the central bank's revised 2025 inflation forecast of 6% (as per the refinancing rate article, implying the current inflation is slightly below this updated forecast). Inflation was particularly pronounced in food products (108.2%), followed by non-food products (102.5%) and paid services (105.6%).\n*   **Refinancing Rate Holds Steady:** The Central Bank of Azerbaijan (CBA) has maintained its key refinancing rate at 7%, with the interest rate corridor unchanged (6% to 8%). This suggests a cautious approach, aiming to anchor inflation expectations without overly stifling economic activity.\n*   **Strengthening International Cooperation:** The CBA has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the People's Bank of China to enhance cooperation in areas such as monetary policy, financial sectors, payment systems, and fintech. This collaboration could lead to knowledge sharing and potential policy alignment.\n*   **New Monetary Policy Framework:** The CBA has presented outlines for a new stage in its monetary policy during an IMF-organized event in Switzerland, indicating a forward-looking approach to monetary management in a dynamic global environment.\n*   **Drop in Fast Transfer Transactions:** As of November 1, the CBA reported a drop in fast transfer transactions, with a total volume of 1.463 billion manats. The reasons for this decline are not detailed but could reflect shifts in consumer behavior or payment preferences.\n\n**Implications:** The 5.9% inflation rate, while elevated, is being managed with a stable interest rate policy. The international cooperation with China and the strategic review of monetary policy frameworks signal a commitment to modernizing and strengthening the CBA's operations. The decline in fast transfers may warrant further investigation into its underlying causes.\n\n## Fiscal Policy & Government Actions\n\n*   **Developing Crypto Regulations:** Azerbaijan is working towards establishing a comprehensive legal framework for virtual assets by the end of 2025. Urgent attention is being given to taxation, regulatory oversight, and institutional involvement in the cryptocurrency sector.\n*   **Unemployment Insurance Budget Approved:** The budget for the Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) for 2026 has been approved at 266.4 million manats, indicating continued government support for labor market stability and worker transition.\n*   **Focus on Mineral-Rich States (Contextual Note):** While not directly about Azerbaijan, the mention of mineral-rich states topping a fiscal index highlights the importance of resource management and fiscal health for economies. This is relevant given Azerbaijan's own resource endowment.\n\n**Implications:** The proactive approach to cryptocurrency regulation demonstrates an effort to embrace emerging financial technologies while ensuring a controlled and transparent environment. The unemployment insurance budget signals a commitment to social safety nets amidst economic shifts.\n\n## Trade & International Relations\n\n*   **Deepening Ties with Israel:** Azerbaijan's Minister of Economy, Mikayil Jabbarov, visited Israel to strengthen bilateral economic and energy cooperation. The discussions aimed to unlock Azerbaijan's geo-economic potential and advance stability.\n*   **Enhanced Cooperation with Jordan:** New agreements have been signed between Jordan and Azerbaijan to enhance economic cooperation, broadening the scope of bilateral partnerships in the region.\n*   **Strengthening Central Asian Ties:** Azerbaijan is being integrated more deeply into the Central Asian economic and political sphere, evidenced by its full participation in the Consultative Meeting of Central Asian Heads of State. This aligns with a broader strategic shift.\n*   **EU Connectivity via Zangezur Corridor:** Baku is actively pursuing closer ties with the European Union, particularly focusing on connectivity, energy, and regional security, with the Zangezur Corridor being a key element of this strategy.\n*   **Diversifying Investment with Qatar:** Qatar has expressed a keen interest in diversifying its investment ventures with Azerbaijan, aiming to broaden the strategic partnership and capitalize on shared interests.\n*   **Pakistan's Commitment:** Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif of Pakistan has reaffirmed a commitment to expanding ties with Azerbaijan, recognizing the consistent growth in bilateral trade and the need for accelerated, diversified economic exchanges. A Pakistan-Azerbaijan Joint Investment Company is also being considered.\n*   **China's Comprehensive Strategic Partnership:** Following a state visit, China and Azerbaijan have elevated their relationship to a comprehensive strategic partnership. This signifies a deep and deliberate strengthening of bilateral ties, moving beyond ceremonial diplomacy.\n*   **Western-Oriented Diplomacy:** Azerbaijan is intensifying its diplomacy with Western partners, including the EU, NATO, and Italy, indicating a balanced and multi-faceted foreign policy approach.\n\n**Implications:** Azerbaijan is actively pursuing a multi-pronged international strategy. The strengthening of ties with Israel, Jordan, Qatar, Pakistan, and China, alongside a concerted effort to engage with the EU and NATO, highlights a desire to leverage its strategic location and resources through diverse partnerships. The focus on regional connectivity, such as the Zangezur Corridor, is a key driver of these international engagements.\n\n## Labor Market & Unemployment\n\n*   **2026 Unemployment Insurance Fund Budget Approved:** The budget for the Unemployment Insurance Fund (UIF) for 2026 has been set at 266.4 million manats. This proactive budgeting demonstrates preparedness for potential labor market fluctuations and a commitment to supporting the unemployed.\n\n**Implications:** The allocation for the UIF suggests that the government is anticipating continued or potentially increased demand for unemployment support, which could be linked to ongoing economic restructuring or external economic factors.\n\n## Currency & Exchange Rates\n\n*   **Manat Stability:** The official exchange rate of the US dollar to the Azerbaijani manat remained unchanged at 1.7 manat as of December 1, 2025. The euro's exchange rate was recorded at 1.9717 manat.\n*   **Challenging Investment Climate:** Despite government efforts to attract foreign investment and introduce reforms, the investment climate in Azerbaijan remains challenging, largely due to the economy's continued heavy dependence on oil.\n\n**Implications:** The stable exchange rate of the manat provides a degree of predictability for businesses and consumers. However, the persistent challenges in the investment climate, linked to the oil dependency, highlight an area requiring sustained reform efforts to fully unlock foreign capital inflows.\n\n## Emerging Themes & Patterns\n\n*   **Strategic Geo-economic Positioning:** A dominant theme is Azerbaijan's active strategy to leverage its geographical location as a bridge between East and West, and Central Asia and Europe. This is evident in its engagement with the EU, China, and Central Asian nations, and its pursuit of connectivity projects like the Zangezur Corridor.\n*   **Economic Diversification Imperative:** While oil remains a significant factor, there is a clear and consistent policy push towards diversifying the economy into non-oil sectors, including technology (cryptocurrency), infrastructure, and regional trade.\n*   **International Partnership Expansion:** Azerbaijan is aggressively seeking to expand its network of international partnerships, ranging from established players like China and the EU to emerging opportunities with Israel, Jordan, and Qatar, indicating a proactive foreign economic policy.\n*   **Modernization of Financial Sector:** The Central Bank's initiatives, including international MOUs and a review of monetary policy frameworks, underscore a commitment to modernizing its operations and aligning with global best practices.",
