While the security aspect is prominent, the emphasis on increased trade suggests that this alliance is intended to foster economic exchange beyond security cooperation. This could lead to new avenues for technology transfer, defense industry collaboration, and potentially trade agreements that benefit both countries.

Increased trade and investment stemming from these partnerships are expected to contribute positively to Paraguay's economic growth in the medium to long term. Further monitoring of specific investment flows and trade balance shifts resulting from these agreements will be critical.",
