  "summary_text": "# Daily Economic Analysis – India (28 Nov 2025)\n\n## 1. GDP & Economic Growth  \n- **Quarterly growth**: India’s economy expanded at an annualised 8.2 % in the September quarter, a notable acceleration from 7.8 % in the June–August period.  \n- **Drivers**: Robust manufacturing output, especially in textiles and auto‑components, offset the drag from 50 % U.S. tariffs on key exports such as steel and machinery.  \n- **Rebalancing trend**: The growth spike is reinforced by a shift towards domestic consumption and digital services, as indicated by the AI‑driven tech boom highlighted at the Delhi AI Impact Summit.  \n- **Implication**: Sustained growth above 8 % signals a return to pre‑pandemic momentum, bolstering investor confidence and supporting fiscal projections for 2026‑27.\n\n## 2. Inflation & Monetary Policy  \n- **Inflation outlook**: Consumer price inflation remains “benign” at 4.5 % (CPI), comfortably within the RBI’s 2–6 % target band.  \n- **Policy stance**: The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) is expected to trim the repo rate by 25 bps to **5.25 %** in December, easing borrowing costs while preserving a buffer against any future price shocks.  \n- **Liquidity picture**: RBI’s reserves have grown to ₹4.8 trn, ensuring ample liquidity for banks and mitigating stress from the U.S. tariff environment.  \n- **Implication**: The rate cut will likely stimulate credit demand, supporting the manufacturing sector’s resilience and potentially nudging inflation marginally higher in the short term.\n\n## 3. Fiscal Policy & Government Actions  \n- **Reform momentum**: The government’s recent tax incentives for AI and data‑science firms, coupled with infrastructure upgrades in Tier‑2 cities, are driving private investment.  \n- **Debt trajectory**: Public debt is projected to rise by 4 % of GDP in FY26, largely financed through a mix of domestic and foreign bonds.  \n- **Implication**: While fiscal consolidation remains a long‑term goal, the current expansionary stance supports growth without jeopardising macro stability.\n\n## 4. Trade & International Relations  \n- **U.S. tariff impact**: Despite a steep U.S. trade policy, Indian exports to the U.S. have only dipped by 2 % YoY, thanks to diversified supply chains and increased intra‑Asia trade.  \n- **Russia partnership**: The opening of a Russian Central Bank office in Mumbai signals deepening financial ties, potentially easing cross‑border payments and hedging against currency volatility.  \n- **AI diplomacy**: India’s bid to shape global AI governance, showcased at the Marseille conference, positions it as a leader in digital sovereignty—an attractive proposition for foreign direct investment (FDI).  \n- **Implication**: Strategic diplomacy in AI and finance is mitigating trade risks, while the domestic manufacturing rebound reduces dependence on U.S. markets.\n\n## 5. Labor Market & Unemployment  \n- **Employment growth**: The National Statistical Office reports a 3.5 % rise in employment, with notable gains in the tech and manufacturing sectors.  \n- **Skill development**: AI‑focused training programs are being rolled out nationwide, targeting a 15 % increase in high‑skill jobs by FY27.  \n- **Implication**: A tightening labor market, coupled with skill upgrades, will support wage growth and consumption—key pillars of the current GDP expansion.\n\n## 6. Currency & Exchange Rates  \n- **INR trajectory**: The rupee has appreciated from ₹82.50 to ₹81.30 per USD in the last month, reflecting higher investor confidence and a lower repo rate environment.  \n- **FX reserves**: India’s foreign exchange reserves climbed to $600 billion, providing a cushion against external shocks.  \n- **Implication**: A stronger rupee benefits importers and reduces inflationary pressure, but may dampen export competitiveness—an effect counterbalanced by the domestic demand surge.\n\n---\n\n### Emerging Themes & Insights  \n\n1. **Resilience Amid External Shocks** – The economy’s growth has not only weathered U.S. tariffs but also benefited from a diversified trade portfolio and domestic demand.  \n2. **AI as an Economic Catalyst** – India’s proactive stance on AI governance and domestic R&D is attracting investment, driving productivity gains, and positioning the country as a global digital hub.  \n3. **Monetary Easing with Inflation Control** – The RBI’s rate cut signals confidence in inflation management while supporting credit flow, a delicate balance that underpins sustained growth.  \n4. **Strategic International Partnerships** – The Russian central bank office and AI diplomacy initiatives underscore a broader strategy to reduce reliance on any single partner and enhance financial resilience.  \n\nIn summary, India’s macro‑economic landscape today is characterized by solid growth, prudent monetary policy, and strategic positioning in AI and international finance. These dynamics collectively suggest a favorable outlook for the coming fiscal year, provided external trade tensions remain manageable and domestic reforms continue to advance.",
