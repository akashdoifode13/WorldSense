This indicates a proactive approach by the BoS to modernize its technological infrastructure. Enhanced IT capabilities within the central bank can lead to greater efficiency in financial data management, improved regulatory oversight, and potentially faster processing of financial transactions. These improvements, while not directly boosting GDP, are foundational elements that can support sustained economic growth by fostering a more robust and responsive financial sector. The focus on in-house expertise suggests a strategic long-term investment in human capital, aiming to build self-sufficiency and reduce reliance on external IT vendors, which could translate into cost savings and greater control over technological development.\n\n### Inflation & Monetary Policy\n\nNo new data or policy announcements regarding inflation or monetary policy were reported today. The current economic environment suggests a continued focus on maintaining price stability, likely through existing monetary tools employed by the Bank of Seychelles. The reported visit to the Bank of Tanzania, however, might indirectly influence future monetary policy implementation. Improved ICT systems within the BoS could enable more sophisticated data analysis and forecasting, potentially leading to more targeted and effective monetary policy decisions in the future.\n\n### Fiscal Policy & Government Actions\n\nNo direct fiscal policy updates or government actions were detailed in the provided news.
